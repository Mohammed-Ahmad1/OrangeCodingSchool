    <h1>Petra</h1>

    <p>
        Inhabited since prehistoric times, this 
        <b>Nabataean</b>
         caravan-city, situated between the Red Sea
        </b> and the <b>Dead Sea</b>, 
        was an important crossroads between Arabia, Egypt 
        and Syria-Phoenicia. Petra is half-built, half-carved into the rock, and is surrounded by 
        mountains riddled with passages and gorges. It is one of the world's most famous 
        archaeological sites, where ancient 
        <b>Eastern</b> 
        traditions blend with 
        <b>Hellenistic</b> architecture.
